        <p>
          Staylio is an independent operator of fully equipped serviced apartments across Central
          London. We started because hotels feel impersonal, holiday lets are inconsistent, and
          renting takes weeks of admin you don&rsquo;t have time for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every apartment is set up so you can arrive, drop your bags, and start living from the
          moment you walk in. Fitted kitchen, fast Wi-Fi, smart TV, fresh linens, full toiletries,
          and all bills already paid. Smart locks let you check in whenever you land. Fortnightly
          housekeeping is included; additional cleans are available on request.
        </p>
        <p>
          We&rsquo;re a small team of real people. When something needs sorting, you can WhatsApp
          us. No call centres, no ticket numbers, no chasing.
        </p>
