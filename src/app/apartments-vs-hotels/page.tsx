    answer:
      "For stays of one week or more, Staylio apartments are typically 15–20% cheaper than equivalent-quality London hotels, before factoring in food savings from having a full kitchen and on-site laundry.",

    question: "What's included in the price of a Staylio apartment?",
    answer:
      "Every Staylio booking includes electricity, water, heating, Wi-Fi, council tax, fresh linens, and full toiletries. Housekeeping is available on request and included on long stays. There are no surprise fees on top of the nightly rate.",

  {
    question: "Are Staylio direct rates lower than Booking.com and Airbnb?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Our direct rates are always at least 10% lower than the same apartment listed on Booking.com or Airbnb, because we don't pay platform commission, we pass the saving back to you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do Staylio apartments come with a kitchen?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Every Staylio apartment has a fully equipped kitchen with induction hob, full-size fridge, dishwasher, oven, microwave, kettle, toaster, and cookware. Most include a coffee machine.",
